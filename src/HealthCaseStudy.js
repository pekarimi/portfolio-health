          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            Managing health information such as accessing doctors' notes or seeking health-related 
            queries can be challenging for older adults who have to manage multiple chronic illnesses. 
            Older adults face accessibility challenges including hearing information and recalling 
            medical instructions that require additional time or follow-up with the doctor.

              <p>
                I conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 older adults to understand their strategies 
                for gathering and recalling medical information, the challenges they face, and their opinions about 
                automatic transcription of their conversations with doctors to help them recall medical information 
                after a visit.

                <ul>
                  <li>Participants face accessibility challenges such as hearing information and recalling medical instructions</li>
                  <li>Patients saw potential value for a tool that automatically transcribes medical conversations</li>

              <h2>Design Process & Research Outcomes</h2>
              <p>
                Through the initial research, I identified key strategies older adults currently use and the 
                challenges they face, which informed the design opportunities for AI-assisted tools to support 
                health information management.

                </div>
                <p>
                  The research revealed that older adults use various strategies like personal notes and family 
                  caregivers, but face significant challenges with hearing impairments and recalling information. 
                  This led to design opportunities for AI-assisted tools that can summarize lengthy text, classify 
                  information into key categories, and highlight critical information.

                <h3>Initial Prototype - Scribe</h3>
                <p>
                  Based on the research findings, I created a mobile interface called Scribe that allows users to 
                  navigate and organize medical conversations as well as set up reminders. The prototype provides 
                  older patients with access to transcripts of medical conversations associated with multiple 
                  doctors' visits. The tool automatically creates notes from doctors' visits that contain key 
                  information to assist individuals in navigating through information.

                  <p>
                    I conducted a user study with 10 older adults (ages 60-78) to evaluate Scribe's perceived usefulness 
                    and ease of use. Participants completed five tasks across three scenarios: recording conversations, 
                    reviewing notes, and managing reminders. Using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), 90% found 
                    Scribe useful and 80% found it easy to use. Key findings showed that participants valued Scribe's 
                    ability to improve organization and navigation of medical information, support recall of complex 
                    medical instructions, and enhance relationships with both formal and informal caregivers by enabling 
                    easy information sharing and reducing dependency on others during visits.

                        from disparate systems, recalling complex medical instructions, and organizing information from multiple doctors), 
                        new challenges emerged. Participants identified needs for improved navigation within the app, enhanced security 
                        and privacy controls, and better tools for interpreting and synthesizing medical information. This analysis 
                        informed the design of subsequent prototypes that focused on addressing these newly identified barriers while 
                        maintaining the benefits of automated conversation capture and organization.

                  MIHA supports older adults with searching and navigating information provided by their 
                  doctor and provides tailored answers to users' questions. It includes several features 
                  to support users' understanding of information through a conversational interface, allowing 
                  patients to ask questions like "Did the doctor prescribe any medicine?" and receive structured, 
                  accessible responses with links to additional resources.

                  <p>
                    I conducted a within-subjects wizard-of-oz study with 10 older adults (ages 61-83) to evaluate 
                    their perceptions of MIHA for navigating personal health information. Participants completed four 
                    tasks across different medical scenarios using doctor's notes from electronic health records. 
                    Results showed that 90% of participants rated MIHA's responses as relevant after viewing the 
                    explanatory notes, and 95% rated closed-ended responses as accurate. Participants valued MIHA's 
                    connection to verified sources (doctor's notes) and its "explainability" features that showed how 
                    responses were derived. Key findings indicated that participants saw MIHA as useful for verifying 
                    medical information at home, managing information from multiple doctors, and becoming more engaged 
                    in their health care. However, participants suggested improvements in understanding question intent, 
                    simplifying medical terminology, and supporting better conversational interactions.

                <h3>Third Prototype - Understanding Automation Preferences</h3>
                <p>
                  Following the development of MIHA, I conducted focus group studies with 9 older adults to investigate 
                  their preferences regarding automation levels across different AI features. The study used a paper 
                  prototype that simulated voice and chat functionalities with varying degrees of automation - from 
                  fully automated features to user-controlled capabilities. This research revealed that older adults' 
                  desired level of automation varied significantly based on task characteristics and complexity.

                  The focus group findings led to the development of a classification framework that categorizes 
                  features according to older adults' interaction preferences: <strong>full delegation</strong> 
                  (for routine tasks like text summarization), <strong>direct control</strong> (for critical tasks 
                  like medical term understanding and information sharing), and <strong>collaborative completion</strong> 
                  (for complex tasks like medical conversation documentation and search functionality).

                that integrates all the tested features into a cohesive, accessible platform for older 
                adults to manage their health information once at home.

                  The final platform organizes medical conversations based on the date and time of each visit into

                  section. Important information can be marked as favorite by selecting save, which stores it in saved 
                  items for easy retrieval. The system also enables sharing of visit information with caregivers, 
                  addressing the research finding that older adults often rely on personal note-taking strategies 
                  and caregiver support to remember important health information.

                  future doctor visits. This design directly addresses the challenge of maintaining personal

                  The study measures user autonomy through multiple dimensions including control over health information 
                  access, confidence in system responses, and perceived support for health management tasks. Early findings 
                  suggest that providing multiple interaction modalities (audio and text), source transparency, and editing 
                  capabilities significantly impacts user trust and sense of control over their health information.
